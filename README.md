## Project Description
Simple Forum is a decentralized message board built on the Flare (Coston2) blockchain.  
Users can create public posts that are permanently stored on-chain, providing a transparent, censorship-resistant messaging system.

The project demonstrates:
- How to interact with smart contracts using **Wagmi + Viem**
- How to perform **read/write operations**
- Wallet-gated UI interactions
- Real-time blockchain updates using transaction receipts

---

## Features
### 🔹 On-Chain Posting
Users can create a forum post using their connected wallet.  
Each post stores:
- Author wallet address  
- Message text  
- Timestamp  

### 🔹 Public Post Feed  
All posts are visible to anyone with access to the application.  

### 🔹 Fully Decentralized
No backend server — all data comes directly from the smart contract.

### 🔹 Wallet Gating
Users must connect a wallet to:
- Create posts  
- View their posting status  

### 🔹 Live Transaction Feedback
The UI shows:
- Pending state  
- Transaction hash  
- Confirmation success  
- Error messages

## How It Solves the Problem  
Traditional platforms store messages on centralized servers, meaning:
- Posts can be censored  
- Data can be modified  
- Ownership is unclear  

**Simple Forum** solves this by placing messages directly on the blockchain:  
- Posts cannot be deleted or altered  
- Users truly own their posts  
- A transparent and immutable public board exists for everyone  

---

## Use Cases  
- Decentralized community boards  
- Blockchain-based discussions  
- Educational demo for new Web3 developers  
- Testing Viem/Wagmi smart-contract integrations  
- Simple on-chain social interactions  

---

## Summary  
Simple Forum is a clean, production-ready example of a decentralized posting system.  
It showcases wallet interaction, contract writes, state tracking, and blockchain-driven UI updates — all in a small, easy-to-understand codebase.
